Create the workspace directory structure for the workforce-assistant plugin. This command sets up:

1. `.workspace/` - Sandboxed working directories for parallel agents
2. `.agent-notes/` - Directory for cross-session notes and research

Execute these steps:

1. Create the directory structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .workspace/{research,implementation,testing}
   mkdir -p .agent-notes
   ```

2. Create a README in `.agent-notes/` explaining the purpose:
   ```bash
   cat > .agent-notes/README.md << 'EOF'
   # Agent Notes Directory

   This directory contains automatically generated notes from the workforce-assistant plugin.

   ## Files

   - `research-YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Research findings with citations (auto-captured from WebFetch/WebSearch)
   - `tool-usage-log.md` - Tool usage patterns for building playbooks
   - `checkpoints-YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Context compaction markers
   - `session-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Session completion summaries

   ## Purpose

   These notes provide:
   - Cross-session continuity (remember what was researched)
   - Decision rationale (why choices were made)
   - Implementation patterns (what tools/approaches worked)
   - Context for new sessions (catch up on previous work)

   ## Usage

   - Research Specialist writes detailed findings here
   - Implementation Engineer reads notes before coding
   - Document Architect uses notes for comprehensive docs
   - All agents reference notes for context

   ## Inspired by

   Eigent's note-taking system for multi-agent coordination.
   EOF
   ```

3. Create a `.gitignore` entry to optionally exclude notes:
   ```bash
   echo "" >> .gitignore
   echo "# Workforce Assistant - uncomment to exclude agent notes from git" >> .gitignore
   echo "# .agent-notes/" >> .gitignore
   echo "# .workspace/" >> .gitignore
   ```

4. Report completion:
   - Workspace structure created
   - Notes directory initialized
   - Ready for multi-agent workflows

The workspace is now ready for:
- Parallel agent execution in isolated directories
- Automatic research capture and note-taking
- Cross-session continuity through persistent notes
